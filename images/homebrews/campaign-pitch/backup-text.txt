# Preface

## Why use this template

A campaign pitch will help players know what to expect during character creation, interact with your world, and keep everyone invested. This template will help create a short 10-minute read that gives a high-level summary of your setting.

Creating a homebrew setting is an experience like none other. However, it is tough to condense this so players can digest it. If players don't understand your world, there is no chance they will interact with it meaningfully. 

### Player Benefits
* Easy 10-minute read to familiarize yourself with the key story beats
* Clear expectations of themes, lines, and veils
* Stress-free system to introduce your character
* Example pictures to help visualize the setting

### DM Benefits
* Step-by-step instructions for how to copy and start writing in minutes
* Opens a transparent dialogue about themes, lines, and veils
* Tips to help players introduce their characters
* Includes a mood board section to provide pictures for the players

### Character Introductions
Character introductions are always a bit awkward for everyone. The players are nervous and want to impress each other. The DM just wants to leave the tavern and start the game. The whole situation is easily overwhelming for many of us. Your players can use the [Character Introductions Worksheet on pages 7 & 8](#p7) to help your session zero go smoother.

### Why we made this template
We've been planning to start a few smaller mini-series or one-shots within the canon of our homebrew world. However, they occur at different points in the universe, so we needed a quick way to convey the critical story beats to the table. Hence, this idea for this template was born.

Using this template, you can follow the quick and easy steps to start writing your campaign pitch in minutes. In addition, we've added sections for you to convey all sorts of crucial information to the table, such as notable characters, known settlements, and even the plot hook.

\column


## Main Plot
A high-level overview of the main plot **without** any spoilers. Where is the tension building? What's happening in the world that causes this game to start...


### Plot Hook
The plot hook is the reason the group of adventurers is formed. Why are they setting out? Who is sending them on a quest? Why did they gather together?

"The adventurers start their journey by not meeting in a tavern because the DM had something more creative written here..."




### Campaign Stems
Like a flower, a campaign stem is a foundation that holds the campaign up and is a driving force for continuous story development. Each of the stems is ranked on a scale of 1 (low) to 5 (high). We recommend using no more than 3 stems at max.

This will help provide a better expectation of what the adventurers will spend most of their time doing. 

|   Stem         |Rating|
|:--------------:|:----:|
| Combat         |  3   |
| Role-Playing   |   4  |
| Self Direction |   5  |

{{note
#### Additional stem options

## Themes Explored
In the game(s), we'll explore some of the following themes:
* High Fantasy with elements of sci-fi tech
* Dystopian Society rebuilding post-war
* Scarcity of resources and knowledge



### Lines
Lines are precisely what they sound like. A hard limit on content that we do not cross or bring into our games. 

The Families & Dragons table's lines are:
* Respect others' personal space.
* No PvP or stealing from the other party members.
* There is no main character; it's a group effort.
* Don't be a creeper, no hankey-pankey at the table.
* If you fail to convince an NPC (deception, intimidation, perception, etc.), what they say goes





### Veils
Veils are when things happen off-screen, such as a fade away or pan away. For example, maybe your character wants to take a long hot bath with a glass of wine. Of course, you can do that, but we don't need to describe it in detail. 

The Families & Dragons table's veils are:
* Scenes where characters are in their birthday suit.
* Anything else you'd like to happen behind closed tavern doors





\column



## State of the World
In the game(s), the world is in a state of... panic? Order? Chaos? Rainbows and sprinkles? 


### Timeline placement
If your world has a continuous timeline across multiple campaigns, explain what year or period the game(s) will take place. If this doesn't apply to you, you can delete this section.


### Magical Advancements
Philosophers, scholars, and practitioners have made significant magical advancements to aid society by:  
* Brooms that sweep the house for you
* Dishes that do themselves
* Magic mushrooms are actually magic!

### Scientific Advancements
Researchers, physicists, and scientists of the world have made advancements to aid society by:
* Universal healthcare for adventurers
* Airships to travel over large oceans to other continents
* Functional plumbing and waste management


### Known Settlements
In this setting, there are some known settlements. These could be capital cities, towns, ports, or other important landmarks.
* Smiles Isle
* The Pride
* Khurrat

### Notable Characters
In society, there are some vital figures or people of importance. These could be political leaders, town elders, or key NPCs with quests.

# Character Introductions Worksheet
## About The Worksheet
Character introductions are always a bit awkward for everyone. The players are nervous and want to impress each other. The DM just wants to leave the tavern and start the game. The whole situation is easily overwhelming for many of us.

Getting this intro phase out of the way in session zero makes the transition to setting off on a quest as a group more fluid. It will also help the characters incorporate their backstories and personal plot points into everyday roleplaying.

### Directions


#### Before session One
Print out this page and provide a copy for each adventurer in the group. Have them fill out this information beforehand. The questions posed are intended to make players think deeper about their character.

#### Character Introductions
Go around the table in order and have each player describe the following about their character:

* Explain the three notable traits of the character's physical appearance.
* Explain two things about the character's vibe or presence.
* Describe one primary motive, secret, or desire of the character
* Bonus Credit: Describe one unique aspect of how they view the world around them.
