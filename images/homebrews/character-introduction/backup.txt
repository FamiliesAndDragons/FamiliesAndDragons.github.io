# Character Introductions Worksheet
## About The Worksheet
Character introductions are always a bit awkward for everyone. The players are nervous and want to impress each other. The DM just wants to leave the tavern and start the game. The whole situation is easily over-whelming for many of us.

Getting this introduction phase out of the way quickly makes the transition to setting off on a quest more fluid. It will also help the characters incorporate their backstories and personal plot points into everyday roleplaying.




### Directions


#### Before The Session
* The DM should print out this sheet and provide a copy for each player in the group.
* Each player should fill out their own sheet answering all questions.
* It's encouraged that players work together or with the DM to ensure their characters are setting-appropriate.



#### During The Session
Go around the table in a predefined order and have each player describe the following about their character:

* Describe **three** notable traits of the character's physical appearance.
* Explain **two** things about the character's vibe or presence.
* Share **one** primary motive, secret, or desire of the character
* Bonus Credit: Describe **one** unique aspect of how they view the world around them.
