            hauling munitions, armor, and weapons. The adventurers chase after the last cart that scurried away before

          <p>Upon returning to Smile City, the whole town is decorated to celebrate the victory at Khuratt. The Heroes enjoy the festivities before heading to the castle to speak with Alannn. He takes them to a viewing chamber where both chimeras are being autopsied. Alannn explains his fears about the motives of The White Scales Empire and how they must take extreme measures to enact a high-level safety protocol across the allied nations. However, as the Heroes ask for more answers, Alannn just can't seem to remember all the details. So he suggests they seek answers from Barbra, the keeper of the Archives.</p>

          <p>After sharing some drinks, Barbra also realizes he is also missing large portions of his memory regarding the safety protocol; however, Barbra knows the cause. Long ago, a group of heroes used ancient magic to end the Epoch of Shadows and return the order to the world. But this power was so great that the Heroes feared it may end up in the wrong hands. So as a preventative measure, they erased all memory of any knowledge relating to this ancient magic, how it was used, or where it was sealed away. Barbra tells the Heroes that the answers they seek are locked away within the World Tree deep in the gardens of the Archives.</p>

Drawing closer to the massive trunk, they were greeted by a physical manifestation of the world tree as it appeared like a very elderly Haverfoot. The adventures soon realize that the Haverfoots are more than just innkeepers; they are the keepers of the World Tree that hold this plane together...</p>

Times of war, times of strife, and times of darkness. The Heroes see seven figures cloaked in light fighting shadow armies, but they are eventually overtaken by the darkness. As the light figures fall, the Heroes catch glimpses of one of their faces. A short gnome with curly brown hair wearing lavish garments, wait... That's Barbra!?!</p>

          <p>The Heroes rush back to the Archives to as Barbra about what they saw. As they hand over the stone tablet, more visions flash before them; Barbra is at a large tablet with a group. There is a male goliath, a female half-elf, what seems to be an old lady, and Alannn? As the Heroes question Barbra further, he recalls more about the missing memories. He explains the visions they saw were the Nine Heroes before the Godless Wars. However, some of the finer points were still missing from his memory. Finally, Barbra provides the last known locations of the Nine Heroes and wishes Yui and Bo luck as they set out on a new mission. Find the other members of The Nine Heroes.</p>
